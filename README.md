Allocated time: approx. 8 hours
### Task description
##### Scope:
You are expected to develop a number of restful endpoints which consume and produce JSON for an example online book shop.
The application should at minimum support the following primary functions:
* A user can register/un-register to the platform.
* A user can access their personal data and update their details (no authentication required).
* A user can list all books currently available in the store.
* A user can purchase books from the store.
* A user can access his purchase history.

##### Instructions:
* Your app should follow clear Domain Driven Design patterns and conventions. Design the app in a way that it is possible to easily eject
and scale domains;
* You can use any PHP framework or library (currently we are using the Laravel framework, or the Lumen micro-framework).
* You should use a MySQL database.
* You should include PSR-3 logging for errors, exceptions, and user/system operations.
* Unit Testing â€“ we would appreciate to see some sort of code coverage. Test what you think is critical.
* Include a README file explaining decisions you made along the way, what you focused on and why.
